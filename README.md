# iOS-Spoofer-X

This project uses python to spoof your iPhone's location, working with Windows (10, 11)

# Requirements

Requirements can be found within requirements.txt. However some important things to note. You must run Command Prompt as administrator, and you must have an iOS device plugged into your computer that has already been trusted (the pop-up on your phone when you first connect). 

You also *MUST* have developer mode enabled on your iPhone when running the script.

You can do this through Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode > ON
